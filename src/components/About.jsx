				<p>
					Hello! I'm an aspiring full-stack developer passionate about crafting
					seamless user experiences and robust backend systems. With a keen
					interest in both frontend and backend development, I thrive on
					bridging the gap between design and functionality. Through hands-on
					mini projects, I’ve gained experience with modern JavaScript libraries
					and frameworks, including React.js and Express.js. These projects have
					allowed me to design, develop, and deploy web applications that
					reflect real-world scenarios. I’m also well-versed in deploying
					websites on cloud platforms like Render, and I’ve worked with AWS EC2
					instances to set up and manage virtual machines. My technical toolkit
					includes a strong understanding of version control systems like Git
					and GitHub, ensuring efficient collaboration and code management. I’m
					excited to continue learning, building, and contributing to projects
					that make an impact in the tech world!
